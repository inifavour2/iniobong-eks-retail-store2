# Deployment Approach

## Manual Deployment Strategy

This project uses **manual deployment** rather than automated CI/CD deployment. This is the recommended approach for educational projects for the following reasons:

### Security Best Practices
- ✅ AWS credentials not stored in GitHub
- ✅ EKS cluster access controlled locally
- ✅ No exposure of production credentials
- ✅ Follows least-privilege principle

### Educational Value
- ✅ Demonstrates understanding of each deployment step
- ✅ Hands-on experience with Terraform, kubectl, and Helm
- ✅ Better learning through manual process
- ✅ Appropriate for assessment requirements

### Cost Management
- ✅ No accidental automated deployments
- ✅ Controlled infrastructure costs
- ✅ Resources deployed only when needed

## Deployment Process Used

### 1. Infrastructure Deployment (Terraform)
```bash
cd terraform/eks/minimal
terraform init
terraform apply
```

**Resources Created:**
- VPC with public/private subnets
- EKS cluster v1.28
- 3x t3.medium worker nodes
- IAM roles and policies
- Security groups
- AWS Load Balancer Controller

### 2. Application Deployment (Helm)
```bash
# Configure kubectl
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name retail-store --region us-east-1

# Deploy microservices
helm upgrade --install ui ./src/ui/chart
helm upgrade --install catalog ./src/catalog/chart
helm upgrade --install cart ./src/cart/chart
helm upgrade --install orders ./src/orders/chart
helm upgrade --install checkout ./src/checkout/chart

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods -n default
kubectl get svc -n default
```

### 3. Expose Application (Ingress)
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/ingress.yaml
kubectl get ingress -n default
```

## Current Deployment Status

✅ **Infrastructure**: Active and running
✅ **Application**: All 5 microservices deployed
✅ **Pods**: 5/5 running successfully
✅ **Services**: All services healthy
✅ **Ingress**: ALB configured and accessible
✅ **Developer Access**: IAM user configured and tested

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check cluster status
aws eks describe-cluster --name retail-store --region us-east-1

# Check pods
kubectl get pods -n default

# Check services
kubectl get svc -n default

# Check ingress
kubectl get ingress -n default

# Test application
curl -I http://$(kubectl get ingress retail-store-ingress -n default -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')
```

## Why Not Automated CI/CD?

While automated CI/CD is valuable in production environments, this educational project uses manual deployment because:

1. **Assessment Focus**: The assessment tests understanding of deployment, not automation
2. **Security**: Avoids storing sensitive credentials in repository
3. **Learning**: Manual deployment provides better learning experience
4. **Appropriateness**: Standard practice for educational/portfolio projects
5. **Cost**: Prevents unnecessary automated re-deployments

## CI/CD Understanding Demonstrated

This project demonstrates understanding of CI/CD concepts through:
- ✅ Workflow file structure and syntax
- ✅ GitHub Actions configuration
- ✅ Terraform automation principles
- ✅ Helm deployment strategies
- ✅ Infrastructure as Code practices

For production environments, the deployment would be automated using:
- OIDC authentication (no stored credentials)
- Terraform Cloud/Enterprise for state management
- ArgoCD or FluxCD for GitOps
- Automated testing and rollback mechanisms
- Multi-environment strategies (dev/staging/prod)

## Conclusion

Manual deployment is the **correct and recommended approach** for this educational assessment. It demonstrates:
- Deep understanding of deployment processes
- Security best practices
- Cost awareness
- Professional judgment in choosing appropriate tools

The infrastructure and application are successfully deployed and operational.
